# Contributing guidelines

### Getting Started

- Install required software
- Clone the repo \
  `git clone https://github.com/smoothdeveloper/zmidi-fs-core.git`

- To build run `dotnet build ci/build.proj`

- To run tests run `dotnet test build.proj -v n`

- N.B. the test suite is downloading a large amount of midi files, and is mostly running the parser on it, which takes long time.
